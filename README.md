# 🌐 **SkillVerse**

**SkillVerse** is a **peer-to-peer skill exchange platform** where people can teach, learn, and grow together — without spending money.
Users create profiles listing skills they **offer** and skills they **want to learn**, then get matched to exchange knowledge in a **credit-based, gamified system**.
